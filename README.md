# Trem das Onze ðŸš†

Welcome to **Trem das Onze**! This is a 2D game where you play as a brave adventurer trying to return home safely.
Fight enemies, avoid obstacles, and collect points to achieve the highest score!

This game was developed as part of a university project to demonstrate skills in game development using Python, some Design Patterns and Object-Oriented Programming.
It features multiple screens, a scoring system, and immersive sound effects.

The name of the game is a homage to the iconic Brazilian song *"Trem das Onze"* by Adoniran Barbosa.
The song is a heartfelt and humorous portrayal of the daily struggles of suburban life. The lyrics tell the story of a man who, living far from the city center, must bid farewell to his beloved to catch the last train home.
Similarly, in this game, you must navigate challenges, make quick decisions, and race against time to make it back safely.
